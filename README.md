Project D 

Scenario

Based upon your previous work with your client, they have asked you to perform a formal penetration
test of a new server. The salient points of your contract are as follows:
Scope of work: The penetration test will be performed during normal business hours. Two
weeks are allocated for the assessment concluding with a presentation to client management
and submission of a formal written report due at the end of that period. A dedicated
workstation located within the client network will be provided for the penetration tester to
perform their assessment. This will be a “black box” scenario, whereby the penetration tester
will not be given any foreknowledge of the server being tested.
Rules of Engagement: The only machine the penetration tester is authorized to scan and exploit
is the new Accounting server. No other machines in the network are to be scanned. Any
information found during the penetration test is to be considered proprietary property of the
client and may not be disclosed to any individuals except the client-designated contact person
for this assessment.
